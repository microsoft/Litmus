## Data for SumEval-2022 Shared-Task

The `train/` directory contains `.json` file for a given task and MMLM (XLMR and TULRv6). Each file consists of a list of dictonaries, where each dictionary is of the form:

```json
{
    "train_config" : {
        "pivot_lang1" : "<Amount of Training Data in pivot_lang1>",
        "pivot_lang2" : "<Amount of Training Data in pivot_lang2>",
        ...
    },

    "eval_results" : {
        "tgt_lang1" : "<Performance on tgt_lang1>:",
        "tgt_lang2" : "<Performance on tgt_lang2>",
        ...
    }
}


```

Each dictionary contains two data structures stored in the keys `"train_config"` and `"eval_results"`. The value of `"train_config"` contains amount of data used in each language (called pivot languages) to fine-tune the MMLM and `"eval_results"` consists of performance of the corresponding model on a set of languages. Note that the set of pivot and target languages may or may note be the same.

The task is to use this data to train a regression model which when given the amount of data used in different languages to fine-tune a given MMLM and a target langauge, predicts the performance of the fine-tuned model on that target language.

As a baseline you may use the [LITMUS tool](https://github.com/microsoft/Litmus) and build your solutions on top of it. Note the repo currently supports mBERT and XLM-R only as the pre-trained multilingual models. We shall release the support for T-ULR models soon.
